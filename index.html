            </h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Tyler, and welcome to my portfolio!
                This is where you'll learn more about me,
                my accomplishments, and my journey in both my
                personal and professional life.
            </p>
            <h2>
                "The mind of a mathematician and the heart of a musician..."
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the world of software development, I approach problems with
                precision and analytical thinking. I believe that the logic and problem-solving
                skills I've developed through studies are crucial in creating "socially responsible"
                code. This mindset not only helps me write better software but
                also allows me to find creative solutions to complex technical challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passion for creativity is expressed through music. I see music as more
                than a beautiful blend of art and science. The mathematical principles that underlie
                music, from rhythms to harmonies, are fascinating, but music has become more and
                more
                ingrained in and with computer software. I love creating and
                performing music that resonates with our hearts and our imagination with
                mathematical and software principles and tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                This synergy allows me to approach projects with a unique perspective. I'm excited
                to discover how these two worlds intersect and make a positive impact on both
                fields and beyond.
