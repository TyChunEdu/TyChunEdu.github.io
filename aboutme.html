    <h1>
        About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Tyler, a 3nd year CS and Music with Concentration in Music
        Technology major at Northeastern University. I have experience in
        computer languages such Java, C#, SQL, Python, JavaScript, and HTML.
        I am also familiar with software such as JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA & Rider,
        PostgreSQL, Unity, Eclipse, Max/MSP, and Ableton Live. I also have a lot
        of experience in education and customer interaction, both of which I value
        greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have many core interests, including music composition/production, sound
        design, video game development, songwriting, and flute performance. I also
        have interests in Spanish (Spanish & Latin music), creative writing,
        storytelling, reading (fantasy, sci-fi, adventure), law, and marine biology.
        I am excited to explore all of these interests further than ever before
        throughout my career.
    </p>
    <p>
        I crave creativity and depth, and always hope to incorporate these ideas in
        everything I do.
    </p>
